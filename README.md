# SecHex

Forked from [here](https://github.com/guolin/crisp-hexo-theme). I used this as a base for my entry into [Hexo](http://www.hexo.io) theming.

This is the theme I use at [SecStorm](http://www.secstorm.com), so you can see it in action there.

## Concept & Notes

Simplicity.

The idea of this theme is to be clean and functional. I didn't pour my heart & soul into this theme because I'd rather spend my time learning information security and writing content for SecStorm.com.

For others, especially another developer, I hope this theme can provide a base that you can then easily add all the bells & whistles you want.

I had thought about incorporating LESS for Hexo, but given that I want to keep things simple for someone else to use, I decided that adding LESS just adds one more thing someone needs to install and use.

## Using SecHex Theme

Once you have NodeJS/Hexo rocking, you can simply git clone this theme into your site's theme directory, like this (assuming you're in the root directory):

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JasonAMartin/SecHex themes/sechex
```

Once that's done, you can edit the config file to use the new theme "sechex" and you're set.

Whenever you want to update, just do a git pull.

Or fork this bad boy and rock your own flavor.
